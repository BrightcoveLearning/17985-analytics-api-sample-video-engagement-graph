# 17985-analytics-api-sample-video-engagement-graph
In this sample, you will learn how to generate an engagement graph for a video in your account. Although you can generate an engagement graph from a video report, here we use a &lt;em>engagement&lt;/em> request, because the response contains more complete data: rollups return engagement for every hundredth segment of the video, while a report returns only engagement at each quarter point of the video

This repository contains all the code for your convenience:
